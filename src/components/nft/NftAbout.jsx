      <p>
        A NFT (non-fungible token) is data added to a file that creates a unique signature. It can be an image file, a song, a tweet, a text posted on a website, a physical item, and various other digital formats.

        This basically means that someone can own a digital file (and that it's marked with code to differentiate it from any digital replicas).

    </div>
